\section{Data Collection}

The VisiBot Processing System was deployed over five weeks from 11/02/2021 to 11/03/2021, resulting in the processing and analysis of 61,293 honeypot packets collected from various strategically located honeypot servers hosted by Bad Packets. As several of these honeypot servers mimic characteristics of commonly targeted IoT devices, this ensures that several types of IoT-based botnet interactions will be caught. The LiSa Sandbox was hosted on a separate server from the VisiBot system to ensure a separation of concerns. All objects generated during malware analysis, such as malware samples, program output logs, and packet capture (pcap) files, are stored on a block-storage partition. Separation ensures that if the sandbox were to become compromised, all the virtual private server could be reset accordingly without the loss of valuable information. All binaries captured by VisiBot were executed within a LiSa sandbox for a total of 30 seconds. 

The distributed processing and analysis of 61,293 honeypot packets lead to the detection of 58,010 unique public IP addresses, including 1,303 candidate Command \& Control servers and 6,876 P2P Nodes. Additionally, the system logged 4,000 Autonomous Systems, 82,050 botnet events, and extracted 9,923 malware payload URLs. Out of the payload URLs extracted, a total of 1,654 malware samples were successfully retrieved, consisting of a total of 150 unique MD5 hashes. Following the analysis of all extracted binaries through VirusTotal, a total of 62,203 out of 97,659 anti-virus vendor scans were detected positive for malware. Through the combination of heuristic-based malware analysis, payload extraction, and the detection of Mirai-like characteristics of honeypot packets, the VisiBot Processing System was successfully able to classify botnet traffic into six categories, as shown below: 

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{results/botnet_distribution_histogram.png}
    \caption{distribution of classified botnet traffic.}
    \label{fig:botnet_distribution} 
\end{figure}

\newpage

The above histogram illustrates that a significant proportion of botnet traffic is that of Mirai-like port-scanning activity. However, a large proportion of botnet traffic also originates from several Peer-to-Peer networks logged during malware analysis of collected binaries. Notably, considerably more malware-hosting Malicious Bots have been observed than that of Report Servers and Payload Servers, which are common to centralised Mirai botnets. The higher number of observed malicious bots may allude to a potential change in contemporary botnet propagation strategies, as botnet developers often employ new de-centralised tactics to mitigate centralised communication between entities such as Report, Payload Command \& Control servers.

\section{Geographic Botnet Distribution}

The 5-week period of automated botnet traffic collection through strategically distributed honeypots yielded a wide collection of geographic information, including the logging of cities, countries, autonomous systems, and geographic coordinates of all IP addresses detected by the processing system. VisiBot successfully processed and classified a magnitude of honeypot information, encountering IP activity spanning across several continents, including Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. Such geographic information can be analysed in a manner of ways to gain a better understanding of how IoT botnets propagate, which countries are specifically being targeted, and how botnets are globally distributed. The below heat-map visualises geographic botnet density through the plotting of latitude and longitude coordinates collected during analysis. Areas of high botnet traffic density are represented using a yellow-red colour gradient, whereas diminished areas are represented as opaque green-blue gradients:

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{results/all_heatmap.png}
    \caption{Geographic distribution of all botnet traffic detected by the VisiBot Processing System.}
    \label{fig:overall_heatmap} 
\end{figure}

As shown above, there is a significant traffic density originating from Asia. More specifically, a lot of the Mirai-like port-scanning activity noted in Figure \ref{fig:botnet_distribution} appears to be originating from China, one of the leading manufacturers of IoT devices. Due to the high-scale production and low-quality control of IoT devices originating from China, such devices may still be prone to known vulnerabilities and exploits. Similar but less dense geographic patterns are also observed across India, Europe, North America, and Brazil. However, a significant proportion of all botnet traffic logged by VisiBot is originating from China. When mapping the geographic distribution of identified Command \& Control candidates and Peer-to-Peer nodes, the traffic density differs significantly from overall traffic distribution. Consider the below side-by-side heat-map visualisations of identified candidate C2 servers and P2P nodes identified by VisiBot:

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \subfloat[\centering Candidate C2 Server Geographic Distribution]{{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{results/c2_heatmap.png} }}
    \qquad
    \subfloat[\centering P2P Node Geographic Distribution]{{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{results/p2p_heatmap.png} }}
    \caption{Malware sample architecture and endianness represented side by side.}
    \label{fig:p2p_c2_heatmaps}
\end{figure}

The above heat-map visualisation of candidate C2 server distribution shows a high density of C2 activity across North America, with some occurrences spanning across Europe and China. There is a clear contrast in traffic distribution when comparing the areas of high geographic C2 density with all botnet traffic distribution. The high level of C2 activity originating from North America indicates that most globally distributed botnets are being controlled by servers or computer systems located in the United States, with some occurrences logged in Central Europe and China. Adversely, most identified Peer-to-Peer botnet traffic is highly prevalent amongst Central Europe and India, with a wider global distribution than Candidate C2 Servers. As Peer-to-Peer botnets operate through communicating with peer nodes, which are often distributed across several countries and continents, a wide geographical distribution can be observed. In contrast, C2 servers often only operate out of specific regions, which are in some cases local to the botmaster. The distinction between the geographic distribution of overall, C2, and P2P traffic is further highlighted when inspecting the distribution of associated Autonomous System registries:

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{results/top_ASN_registries.png}
    \caption{distribution of classified botnet traffic across ASN registries.}
    \label{fig:asn_registries_barchart} 
\end{figure}

Both the APNIC and RipeNCC ASN registries are widely associated with Mirai-like scanning, malicious botnet, and Peer-to-Peer activity. The bulk of identified port-scanning, malicious, and Peer-to-Peer botnet activity originates from IP addresses provided by Autonomous Systems operating within Asia-Pacific and Central/Eastern Europan regions. Adversely, the ARIN registry is more frequently associated with candidate C2 traffic and Peer-to-Peer traffic, with little occurrence of a malicious bot, report server or payload server activity seen across the United States, Canada, and North Atlantic. These findings are further validated by measuring the distribution of Autonomous Systems based on their country of origin:

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{results/top_10_asn_countries_overall.png}
    \caption{Top 10 ASN country codes for overall botnet traffic.}
    \label{fig:overall_asn_country_barchart} 
\end{figure}

As inferred in Figure \ref{fig:overall_heatmap}, the above graph confirms that the leading country of origin for overall botnet traffic is indeed China, followed by India, the United States, and Russia. Using this information, we can deduce that IoT device traffic originating from China is primarily that of port-scanning and malicious bot activity. However, when inspecting the geographic distribution of ASNs associated with C2 or P2P botnet traffic, the origin of such traffic differs significantly from the geographic distribution of overall traffic:

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \subfloat[\centering Top 10 Candidate C2 Server ASN Country Codes ]{{\includegraphics[width=6.55cm]{results/top_10_asn_countries_c2.png} }}
    \qquad
    \subfloat[\centering Top 10 P2P Node ASN Country Codes]{{\includegraphics[width=6.55cm]{results/top_10_asn_countries_p2p.png} }}
    \caption{A side-by-side comparison of the geographic distribution of Autonomous Systems associated with P2P and C2 botnet activity.}
    \label{fig:p2p_c2_asn_dist}
\end{figure}

The above comparison illustrates a clear contrast between the distribution of C2, P2P, and overall traffic across the geographic regions of associated Autonomous Systems. The distribution of C2 ASN countries of origin confirms that most detected candidate C2 traffic originates from the United States. Contrary to that of C2 ASN distribution, logged Peer-to-Peer traffic predominantly originates from Autonomous Systems located in India, Russia, the United States, Albania, and South Korea, affirming that P2P botnet networks are more widely dispersed than that of C2 and propagation activity. Notably, most of the overall botnet traffic originates from IP addresses associated with AS4837 (China Unicom Backbone) and AS9829 (Bharat Sinchar Nigam Ltd.), located in China and India, respectively. The VisiBot Processing system also detected a significant amount of C2 botnet traffic originates from North American providers AS16625 (Akamai Technologies, Inc.) and AS16509 (Amazon.com). Diversely, the bulk of detected P2P traffic is more widely distributed across several ASNs, including AS8661 (Telekomi i Kosoves SH.A), AS9829 (Bharat Sinchar Nigam Ltd.), AS4766 (Korea Telecom), AS17465 (Asianet Satelite Communications), and AS12389 (Rostelecom). For the top 10 Autonomous Systems Numbers across C2, P2P, and overall botnet traffic, see Appendix \ref{appendix_a9}. 






















\section{Traffic Analysis}

Despite a large proportion of benign botnet activity shown in Figure \ref{fig:botnet_distribution}, such as port-scanning activity, the second most commonly occurring traffic type is that of Peer-to-Peer Botnet traffic. As P2P nodes are identified during the malware analysis stage of the VisiBot Processing System, this indicates current popularity in the use of de-centralised Peer-to-Peer based infrastructures, like that of IoT botnets such as Hajime. Additionally, the number of packets classified as malicious botnet activity is significantly higher than that of identified payload and report server activity. The concept of a self-propagating malicious bot is a relatively new phenomenon amongst IoT botnet traffic, as such bots actively attempt to infect vulnerable devices using self-hosted malware. In comparison, conventional Mirai bots often report the detection of vulnerable devices to a report server, which performs remote code execution using malware hosted on a payload server. As self-hosted malware mitigates payload servers' requirement and allows for de-centralised propagation, this may explain why recently observed botnets utilise malicious bots more often than report or payload servers. 

In order to gain a better understanding the IoT devices which are currently being attacked, the VisiBot Processing System logs the detected packet categories and Common Vulnerability Exploits (CVEs) included within the packet information provided by the Bad Packets honeypot API. \citep{BadPackets} The below table represents the top 10 most commonly observed botnet packet categories and CVEs across all traffic classified by the VisiBot Processing System:

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \caption{Top 10 CVEs and packet categories across all botnet traffic}
    \centering
    \label{tab:cve_categories}
    \rowcolors{2}{}{gray!3}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
    \hline
    \textbf{CVE} & \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Count} \\ \hline
    -               & Botnet Activity & Mirai-like Scan & 43,552 \\ \hline

    CVE-2016-6277   & Router          & Netgear RCE & 310 \\ \hline
    -               & IoT             & Vacron NVR RCE & 298 \\ \hline
    -               & IoT             & Generic CCTV-DVR RCE & 289 \\ \hline

    CVE-2013-3568   & Router          & Linksys RCE & 67 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Botnet coordinators appear to be explicitly targeting IoT devices with known vulnerabilities through various attempts of Remote Code Execution (RCE). Malicious bots and/or report servers target devices such as routers, IP cams, and DVRs, all of which may be vulnerable to default login credential brute-force attacks. Given the continued use of exploits known for a considerable amount of time, this indicates that there is still a significant amount of unpatched devices that attackers can infiltrate. Upon manual analysis of several attack packets collected by the honeypot, it was observed that several infected devices were attempting to perform remote code execution using bash scripts hosted on remote payload servers. These bash scripts are used to ensure that the correct malware binary is executed on an infiltrated device, such that MIPS IoT devices are infected with a MIPS-compile binary and so-on. This ensures that botnets can propagate through various CPU architectures, such as those listed in the table above.

































\section{Malware Analysis}

The previous observation of potential target CPU architectures is reaffirmed by the findings obtained through static analysis of several malware binaries collected during the data collection period of the VisiBot Processing System. As shown in figure \ref{fig:arch_vs_endianess}, static analysis of the extracted binaries collected by the VisiBot Processing System indicates that ARM and MIPS CPU architectures are currently being targeted at a high rate, with only 1.3\% of binaries targeting x86 devices. Similarly, botnets are mostly attacking IoT devices with big-endian memory addresses. This combined analysis indicates that the vast majority of detected traffic originates from IoT botnets, which explicitly target a wide range of devices distributed across two microprocessor architectures.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \subfloat[\centering Malware Architecture]{{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{results/arch_piechart.png} }}
    \qquad
    \subfloat[\centering Malware Endianess]{{\includegraphics[width=6cm]{results/endianess_piechart.png} }}
    \caption{Malware sample architecture and endianess represented side by side.}
    \label{fig:arch_vs_endianess}
\end{figure}

Given these findings, it is likely that the types of botnets identified by the VisiBot Processing System are likely Mirai or Bashlite variants, as they are exclusively targeting IoT devices running on microprocessor technology. The distribution of identified botnet variants can be calculated by scanning each binary using VirusTotal and extracting the top-most occurring keyword across the positive vendor scan results. When a malware vendor positively identifies a binary as malicious, the malware's name is often characterised as a string, such as \texttt{Type:Platform/MalwareFamily}. As the result strings for positive vendor scans are given through the VirusTotal API, information such as the malware family can be parsed and sorted based on occurrence, such that keyword identifiers can be extracted. The below table shows the most commonly occurring VirusTotal keywords across all analysed malware binaries:

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{results/vt_keywords.png}
    \caption{distribution of malware samples based on VirusTotal keywords}
    \label{fig:vt_keywords} 
\end{figure}

Although the vast majority of analysed binaries were detected as Mirai malware variants by the VirusTotal anti-virus vendors, some were also identified as Bashlite (gafgyt) and coin-miners. The "hit" keyword associated with three binaries was extracted from the anti-virus result string \texttt{Trojan.Linux.Agent.HIT}, revealing that despite testing positive, most VirusTotal anti-virus vendors were unable to detect the exact malware families of the binaries. Binaries that were not detected by the VirusTotal vendor scanning service were allocated the \texttt{(null)} placeholder keyword. 






















\subsubsection{Netowrk Analysis}

During the network analysis stage of LiSa sandbox analysis, several network interactions originating from the infected sandbox host were logged, including all HTTP requests, DNS look-ups, and IRC Traffic. The logged HTTP requests were very typical to that of Mirai and Bashlite botnets, as several attempts were made by the infected host to brute-force and perform remote code execution on identified vulnerable devices. However, a significantly low number of DNS queries were observed throughout analysis of all 1,654 binaries, as a total of only 10 unique DNS look-ups were performed across all infected hosts:

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \centering
    \caption{Table of all DNS Queries logged during malware analysis}
    \label{tab:dns_queries}
    \rowcolors{2}{}{gray!3}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Domain} & \textbf{Record Type} & \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Total} \\ \hline
    dht.transmissionbt.com & A    & P2P DHT & 637 \\ \hline
    router.bittorrent.com  & A    & P2P DHT &  463 \\ \hline
    router.utorrent.com    & A    & P2P DHT &  452 \\ \hline
    bttracker.debian.org   & A    & P2P DHT &  441 \\ \hline
    jebiga.babyhub.pw      & A    & C2 Server &  6 \\ \hline
    hjar64zj6ygjd.com      & A    & C2 Server  &  2 \\ \hline
    cnc.fewbots.cc         & A    & C2 Server  &  1 \\ \hline
    g*y.energy             & A    & C2 Server  &  1 \\ \hline
    g*y.energy             & AAAA & C2 Server  &  1 \\ \hline
    ipinfo.io              & A    & Benign &  1 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Notably, only four potential Command \& Control server DNS recorders were identified, with most DNS lookups being associated with public Peer-to-Peer services and Distributed Hash Tables. Of the C2 DNS records identified, one domain name shows low vowel density and high Sharron entropy (randomness), common to that of conventional Mirai C2 domain names. \citet{Dwyer2019} However, as shown,  DNS based botnet detection would not have proved beneficial in this case as a small number of DNS lookups were observed. The querying of public P2P service domains is a relatively innovative characteristic of de-centralised IoT botnets, such as Hajime or Mozi. Once a bot is infected, it will attempt to access the botnet DHT through public BitTorrent services, such as those logged above. Such DNS queries were previously observed in Mozi botnet network activity by \citep{Netlab2019}. A high occurrence of Mozi malware amongst collected binaries can be observed in the word-cloud generated in Appendix \ref{appendix_a8}, validating that a large proportion of the botnet traffic detected by the VisiBot Processing System originates from the Mozi botnet. The filenames \texttt{Mozi.a} and \texttt{Mozi.m} also signify devices running on \textbf{a}rch and \textbf{m}ips CPU architectures are being directly targeted by Mozi. 

\subsubsection{Malware Port Usage}

The UDP and TCP network statistics are shown in Appendix \ref{appendix_a7} also reaffirms that the majority of detected botnet traffic is specific to the targeting of IoT, as devices are mostly targeted via Telnet (22/2323) and HTTP (80) via the TCP protocol. As many IoT devices have vulnerabilities in online dashboards, attackers often attempt credential brute-forcing, and remote code execution (RCE) exploits on IoT dashboards/panels accessible through port 80. Other highly targeted TCP ports, such as 5555, 49152, and 37215, are ports commonly used by IoT devices such as IP cameras and routers. Highly targeted ports, such as 7574, are associated with cluster services such as the Oracle Coherence Cluster service, indicating that attackers may be actively trying to infiltrate cluster systems using known exploits. Notably, ports 443 and 22, commonly used with HTTPS and SSH, are very low on the list of targeted TCP ports. This suggests that attackers are less concerned with the brute-forcing of SSH clients and routing of traffic through secure network layers such as HTTPS.

In contrast to TCP, the UDP ports 67, 1900, 53, and 6881 were also largely targeted by bots observed throughout malware sandbox analysis. The UDP port 53 is often listened to by worms and botnets awaiting incoming commands from the C2 servers. \citep{SpeedguidePort53} Whereas, ports 67 and 1900 are typically used by DHCP servers and UPnP devices, as highlighted in Table \ref{tab:cve_categories}. However, the vast majority of logged UDP traffic (shown in Figure \ref{fig:udp_port_stats}) is widely and randomly distributed across various ports. These unusual characteristics may be an indication of malicious bot activity associated with Mozi botnets. Mozi bots propagate the botnet through self-hosting malware on local web servers hosted at randomly selected UDP ports. The files hosted on the temporary web-server are downloaded when the malicious bot successfully brute-forces or performs remote code execution on a vulnerable IoT device. After some time, the port of the web-server changes to a different randomly selected port. The presence of such activity may explain why a high number of malware payload URLs were extracted from detected honeypot packets, but only a small percentage of binaries were actually retrievable. It is possible that the VisiBot Processing System wasn't quick enough in retrieving malware binaries from certain URLs. This issue may be caused b the limitation of having to query the honeypot service used by VisiBot on an hourly basis. Should packets be processed immediately upon identification, it is likely that the URL pointing to a randomly selected port will still be active, and a higher number of binaries can therefore be extracted.

\subsubsection{P2P Payload Connections Analysis} Generated using NetworkX \citep{NetworkX} and the K-Components approximation algorithm \cite{NetworkXKComponents}, the below edge-connectivity graph visualises the various relationships between analysed malware binaries and identified Peer-to-Peer networks using the IP address connection relationship information logged throughout network analysis of analysed malware binaries:

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{results/p2p_payload_network.png}
    \caption{Edge-connectivity graph of P2P Node and malware binary interactions recorded during network analysis. Edge connections approximated using K-Components algorithm.}
    \label{fig:p2p_payload_networks} 
\end{figure}

Several small-scale Peer-to-Peer botnets are shown throughout the perimeter of the graph, with several P2P networks being interlinked through some mediary P2P nodes. As shown, various of the small-scale P2P networks detected during analysis are interlinked with each other, and with larger P2P networks spanning across the centre of the graph. The blue mass of Peer-to-Peer nodes at the centre of the visualisation indicates botnet propagation growth of one or more large P2P botnets over the 5-week data collection period, as several connections between P2P nodes have been established across multiple payload binaries which are likely to originate from the same botnet. However, as public distributed hash tables are often used in Peer-to-Peer botnets, it is likely that a high proportion of this traffic is legitimate, as bots often interact with legitimate peers to throw-off potential network analysis. \citep{Herwig2019} A summary of the number of nodes associated with malware payloads is shown below:

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \centering
    \caption{Summary: Number of P2P Nodes identified during malware binary analysis.}
    \label{tab:p2p_payload_summary}
    \rowcolors{2}{}{gray!3}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Min} & \textbf{1st Quartile} & \textbf{Median} & \textbf{Mean} & \textbf{3rd Quartile} & \textbf{Max} \\ \hline
    1.0 & 5.0 & 12.0 & 12.75 & 18.0 & 69.0 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Candidate C2 Server ASN History Analysis} The relationships between identified candidate C2 servers and Autonomous Systems can also be visualised using the same K-Components approximation algorithm used above. Using  the recent ASN history of all candidate C2 Servers, sourced from various WHOIS records via ipwhois \citep{ipwhois}, the below network graph illustrates the historical interactions, such as ownership or temporary holdings, between Autonomous Systems and identified candidate C2 servers:

\begin{figure}[!htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{results/c2_asn_network.png}
    \caption{Edge-connectivity graph of P2P Node and malware binary interactions recorded during network analysis. Edge connections approximated using K-Components algorithm.}
    \label{fig:c2_asn_networks} 
\end{figure}

\begin{table}[!htb]
    \centering
    \caption{Summary: Number of ASNs associated with 1,157 candidate C2 Servers}
    \label{tab:c2_asn_history_summary}
    \rowcolors{2}{}{gray!3}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Min} & \textbf{1st Quartile} & \textbf{Median} & \textbf{Mean} & \textbf{3rd Quartile} & \textbf{Max} \\ \hline
    1.0 & 3.0 & 5.0 & 5.437 & 9.0 & 10.0 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

As shown above, the central network indicates that several ASNs are holding/exchanging ownership of IP addresses associated with Command \& Control activity detected by VisiBot. Additionally, it is observed that a high number of C2 IP addresses are owned by a select few Autonomous Systems, with a mean average of 5 ASNs associated with identified candidate Command \& Control servers. An iterative graph-based monitoring tool can be built using this information to observe the interactions between C2 Servers and ASNs. Such observations may allow for insight into the trading/holding process of IP addresses associated with botnet activity amongst Autonomous Systems.



\section{Evaluation}

Over a 35-day experimentation period, the distributed honeypot system, automated malware extraction, and botnet classification processes employed by VisiBot enabled the detection of over 58,010 unique IP addresses and the collection of 1,654 malware samples comprised of 150 unique MD5 hashes over a 35-day period. In comparison, the IoTPoT honeypot system proposed by \citet{PaPa2016} identified a total of 16,934 visiting IP addresses and collected 43 unique malware samples over a 39-day evaluation period. The significant difference in the number of unique IP addresses encountered highlights the advantages of using a strategically distributed honeypot network. The extensive, worldwide, and intelligent honeypot services provided by \citet{BadPackets} permitted the processing of thousands of honeypot packets per day, enabling the significantly higher collection of malware samples over a shorter evaluation period.

Given the significant number of malware URLs extracted during the experimentation period, the payload URL extraction employed by VisiBot has proven highly effective. The combination of regular expression pattern matching and manual re-building of URLs obfuscated using command-line arguments allows for the efficient and computationally inexpensive identification of sample URLs used in botnet remote code execution attacks. However, as a large number of malicious botnets has been observed throughout the experimentation period, a considerable proportion of the extracted malware URLs were no longer active by the malware analysis stage. This resulted in significantly fewer malware binaries being collected for analysis. 

However, out of the 9,923 URLs identified, only 1654 binaries could be collected due to limitations presented by the honeypot system used by VisiBot. During the 35-day experimentation period, VisiBot encountered a significant number of malicious bots originating from the Mozi botnet variant, which actively perform remote code execution attacks using self-hosted malware samples. However, as the corresponding port of the web-server used for hosting malware changes to a new randomly selected port on a frequent basis, a small window of time is given to download the binary before the URL expires. As the VisiBot Processing System retrieves honeypot data on an hourly basis from an external honeypot service, the hour-long delay between intrusion detection and analysis often results in such malware URLs expiring before binaries can be downloaded and analysed. A possible solution is to use a real-time stream or socket-based honeypot API, allowing for packets to be analysed within a short time-frame of being detected by a given honeypot. By doing so, a larger proportion of self-hosted payload URLs can be collected.

The implementation of a scalable and distributed sandbox analysis system allows for automatic static, dynamic and network analysis of malware samples extracted from the honeypots utilised by VisiBot. In doing so, the VisiBot Processing System was able to identify significant botnet traffic following the heuristic analysis of 1318 out of 1654 malware binaries, yielding an identification rate of 79.87\%. Opposed to these results, the botnet detection techniques and heuristics employed by \citet{Bastos2019} permitted the C2 server detection of 1010 out of 1050 malware samples, resulting in a detection rate of 96\% across all samples. However, both systems are comparably different as the system proposed by \citet{Bastos2019} is exclusively concerned with the identification of Centralised Command \& Control servers from the conventional IoT botnets, Mirai and Bashlite, and does not consider approaches for identifying de-centralised botnets. Whereas the VisiBot Processing System is primarily concerned with the identification of both centralised and de-centralised IoT Botnets, allowing for the detection of C2 servers and Peer-to-Peer botnet traffic generated by relatively new botnet variants such as Mozi and Hajime. Nevertheless, one significant drawback of the VisiBot Processing System, in its current state, is that there is no validation process in-place for confirming the validity of identified candidate C2 and P2P traffic through the likes of executing hand-shaking procedures. As many de-centralised botnets communicate with legitimate public Peer-to-Peer networks, and centralised botnets are known to communicate with fake C2 servers, all entities identified through heuristic analysis must be further validated through the invocation of botnet handshake procedures. Due to time constraints, this functionality is not yet present in the VisiBot Processing System, yet, the malware analysis process can be conveniently extended to include such validation procedures. 

A considerable number of candidate C2 servers and P2P Nodes were detected through the VisiBot Processing System, indicating that the chosen heuristics are effective in differentiating between benign and malicious botnet traffic. However, the lower detection rate indicates when compared to other systems indicates that some of the heuristics used were less effective than anticipated. During the data collection period, a high number of packed malware binaries were observed, mostly through the UPX packing tool \citep{UPX}. Despite making modifications to the LiSa sandboxing server to enable the unpacking of UPX binaries, a large number of samples could not be successfully unpacked. This resulted in the collection of obfuscated binary strings during static analysis, which proved too noisy for the extraction of hard-coded IP addresses. Following this, the heuristic-based on detection of connections to hard-coded IP addresses proved the least effective across all four heuristics. However, with further improvements to binary un-packing procedures, this heuristic will likely prove more advantageous for identifying candidate Command \& Control servers.

Throughout the entirety of the 35-day data collection period, the VisiBot Processing System has proven highly reliable and robust, having automated extensive analysis procedures for over 61,000 honeypot events. The logging of botnet entity interactions, traffic classifications, sample analysis information, geographic data, and autonomous system history allows for many insights to be made regarding the current state and potential evolutionary patterns of IoT Botnets. The collection and analysis of malware binaries have proven useful in identifying the source of control amongst centralised and de-centralised botnets. However, analysis of target binary CPU architectures and frequently observed Common Vulnerability Exploits also give insight into how IoT botnets are propagating and the types of exploit mechanisms that are being employed by botnet developers. Graph-based visualisations of C2 and Autonomous System interactions also provide insight into the interplay between Autonomous Systems and botnet IP addresses. Similarly, the visualisation of Peer-to-Peer connections observed between malware payloads can be used to measure the rate at which such botnets are propagating. Additionally, visualisations can assist with identifying centralised interactions between P2P node IP addresses. Collectively, the variety of information collected by the VisiBot Processing System is highly significant within the context of Cyber Threat Intelligence.
