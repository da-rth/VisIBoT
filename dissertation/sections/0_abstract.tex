    ``XYZ is bad. This project investigated ABC to determine if it was better. 
    ABC used XXX and YYY to implement ZZZ. This is particularly interesting as XXX and YYY have
    never been used together. It was found that  
    ABC was 20\% better than XYZ, though it caused rabies in half of subjects.''
