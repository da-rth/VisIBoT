      The substantial demand for the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the
      mass production of IoT devices susceptible to common security
      vulnerabilities, such as login credential brute-forcing and Remote Code
      Execution (RCE). Bad actors have begun to exploit such vulnerabilities in
      IoT devices to build powerful IoT botnets to coordinate large-scale
      distributed cyber-attacks. The detection and mitigation of such botnets is
      a high priority for authorities and cyber-threat intelligence specialists,
      as such cyber-attacks have proven to impact countless services,
      organisations, and government entities significantly. However, the
      identification of modern botnets, such as those targeting IoT devices, has
      proven challenging for authorities due to continually changing
      communication protocols, target devices, attack vectors, and obfuscation
      techniques.
      <br /><br />
      VisiBot allows for real-time, flexible, and fully automated botnet
      detection, capable of identifying centralised and de-centralised IoT
      botnets. In collaboration with Bad Packets, the VisiBot Processing System
      automatically extracts malware sampels from a network of globally
      distributed honeypots and actively identifies candidate C2 servers and P2P
      traffic using heuristic-based analysis.
